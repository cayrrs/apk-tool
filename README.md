# apk tool
installs apks from github release urls or from file. (now without curses!!!)

# how to use?
you first need Python. [Python Download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.2/python-3.13.2-amd64.exe)
I highly recommend you store the script into another folder on your desktop. Mostly because the script downloads into the directory the script is in.

# is this safe?
check the code for urself lmao
(but seriously, if u think this is malicious or malware, look at the code.)
