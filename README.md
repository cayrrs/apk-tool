# apk tool
installs apks from github release urls or from file. (now without curses!!!)

# how to use?
download the release exe and run it
I highly recommend you store the script into another folder on your desktop. mostly because the script downloads into the directory the script is in.

# is this safe?
check the code for urself lmao
(but seriously, if u think this is malicious or malware, look at the code.)

# build
install pyinstaller (pip install pyinstaller)

pyinstaller --onefile apktool.py
